      My main interests are software & data. It did not start out that way, however. I have been trained as a microbiologist during my Bsc.
      Then the COVID pandemic hit and I was forced to work from home. Rather than getting my hands dirty in the wetlab, I started to work in silico. That's how I got to know 
      the field of computer science (CS). It was love at first sight. Because I liked developing so much, I decided to switch to CS. I still very much like to apply CS to biological data, so most of my projects are dedicated to that.

      Besides science, I also love reading and I have a keen interest in politics. Lastly, I recently found out how much fun padel is!
